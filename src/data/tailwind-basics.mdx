# 🌀 Tailwind CSS Basics: A Beginner's Guide

If you've ever felt overwhelmed by writing custom CSS or switching between your HTML and stylesheets constantly, **Tailwind CSS** might be just what you need.

It's a **utility-first CSS framework** that helps you build sleek, responsive UIs with minimal hassle. Let’s dive into the basics.

---

## 🔧 What Is Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind gives you **utility classes** like `p-4`, `text-center`, `bg-red-500`, and many more. These classes let you style elements directly in your HTML (or JSX), avoiding the need for writing custom CSS for everything.

> 💡 Think of it like Lego blocks for styling.

### 👎 Traditional CSS

```css
/* custom-styles.css */
.btn {
  background-color: #3b82f6;
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
  border-radius: 0.25rem;
  color: white;
}
```

### 👍 With Tailwind

```html
<button class="bg-blue-500 px-4 py-2 rounded text-white">Click me</button>
```

## ⚙️ Installation (Quick Setup)

Getting started is easy:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init
```

In your CSS file (e.g., `index.css`), add the following:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Then update your `tailwind.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  content: ["./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

Finally, import your CSS in the root of your app (e.g., `_app.tsx` if you're using Next.js).
