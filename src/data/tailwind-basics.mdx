## 🔧 What Is Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind gives you **utility classes** like `p-4`, `text-center`, `bg-red-500`.  
No need to write custom CSS every 2 minutes like a clown.  
Just slap classes and move on.

> 💡 Think of it like Lego blocks but for styling — plug and play.

### 👎 Traditional CSS Approach

```css
/* custom-styles.css */
.btn {
  background-color: #3b82f6;
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
  border-radius: 0.25rem;
  color: white;
}

### 👍 Tailwind Version

<button class="bg-blue-500 px-4 py-2 rounded text-white">Click me</button>
```
